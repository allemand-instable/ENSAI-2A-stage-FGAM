    abstract  = {Consider a $p$-times differentiable unknown regression function $\theta$ of a $d$-dimensional measurement variable. Let $T(\theta)$ denote a derivative of $\theta$ of order $m$ and set $r = (p - m)/(2p + d)$. Let $\hat{T}_n$ denote an estimator of $T(\theta)$ based on a training sample of size $n$, and let $\| \hat{T}_n - T(\theta)\|_q$ be the usual $L^q$ norm of the restriction of $\hat{T}_n - T(\theta)$ to a fixed compact set. Under appropriate regularity conditions, it is shown that the optimal rate of convergence for $\| \hat{T}_n - T(\theta)\|_q$ is $n^{-r}$ if $0 < q < \infty$; while $(n^{-1} \log n)^r$ is the optimal rate if $q = \infty$.},

    abstract  = {In this chapter we introduce the Radon-Nikod{\'y}m property for Banach spaces. We begin with a study of vector measures, that is, measures with values in a Banach space. Those spaces for which the classical Radon---Nikod{\'y}m Theorem extends to vector valued measures are said to have the Radon---Nikod{\'y}m property. The identification of injective and projective tensor products of spaces of scalar measures in terms of spaces of vector measures sheds some light on this property. We then examine the representability of various types of operators on C(K) and L1($\mu$) spaces and we uncover some classes of Banach spaces, such as the reflexive spaces and the separable dual spaces, that possess the Radon-;Nikod{\'y}m property. We also relate the possession of this property to the coincidence of the integral and nuclear operators Finally, we give some applications of the Radon-Nikod{\'y}m property, including the Principle of Local Reflexivity.},
